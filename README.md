# Mask-detection
In this project I have trained a CNN model for detecting mask and wihtout mask people. As per current scenario, the world is going through a pandemic situation due to COVID-19, due to which some guidelines are being proposed by the government.
In lieu to the laws, wearing mask is made mandatory for everyone going out for any work. This project works with the surveillance cameras placed at some high rush places. The camera will detect whether the person has wore a mask or not.
